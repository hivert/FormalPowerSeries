(** * Truncated power series

We define the following notions (where in the following [R] is a ring and [n]
is an integer)

- [{tfps R n}] == The truncated power series ring with coefficient in [R] and
                  order of truncation [n] (which is included). So the series
                  are computed modulo [X^{n+1}]

- [is_stdtab t] == [t] is a *standard tableau* that is a tableau whose row
            reading is a standard word - [last_big t b] == the index of the
            first row of [t] which ends with [b] - [remn t] == remove the
            largest entry ie [n] from a standard tableau of size [n] -
            [conj_tab t] == the conjugate standard tableau of [t] (this is
            indeed a tableau when [t] is itself a standard tableau.

                                                                              *)
