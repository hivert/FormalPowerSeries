# FormalPowerSeries
Formal power series in mathcomp

All these files are experimental

To compile it I'm using the following opam packages:
```
coq-mathcomp-ssreflect 1.10.0
coq-mathcomp-algebra   1.10.0
coq-mathcomp-analysis  0.2.3
coq-mathcomp-finmap    1.4.0
```

The objective are the formalisation of

- truncated formal power series with no axioms
- inverse limits using classical axioms
- formal power series using classical axioms
- as an example: the formula for Catalan numbers
